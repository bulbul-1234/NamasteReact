    <!--Just get a cdn link and use it, by this we can bring react in our project.
    there are two files, first is- core file of react(core fundamentals)
    second is useful for dom operation, to modify the dom
    why different file?
    React doesn't only work for browsers, it also work for mobile like reactnative, react3d is also there-->
