     The React framework offers a shorthand syntax for fragment components that appears as an empty tag: <></> . While it is supported in JSX syntax, it is not part of the HTML standard and thus is not supported natively by browsers. 


Q5. What is Virtual DOM?
->  A virtual DOM object is the same as a real DOM object, except that it is a lightweight copy. This means that it cannot manipulate on-screen elements. Moreover, upon any change of a property, it only updates the corresponding nodes and not the entire tree.
 
 Real DOM is what we see on our browser screen and virtual DOM is copy of it. The main difference is that when we make changes in any part of real DOM, It re-renders the whole DOM at once and that affects efficiency of our server loading cause it has to reload the whole page as browser can only read JS, Html/CSS.
