JSX is not part of React and we can write React without JSX as well.
But JSX makes our life easy.

Browser undersatnds ecmascript

Babel-
It's a opensource JS Compiler
Converting our code JSX code into React Code.
Transpiler

Attributes in JSX are used in camelCase

Single line JSX is fine but if we wanna make it in multiple lines then we have to use ()



Component Composition-
Component inside a component is called Componennt Composition.

Cross side Scripting-
If attacker is attacking through api.
but JSX takes care of these attacks and escape these.
If anything is wrapped inside curly braces the it will first sanitize the data and then pass it.
{data}
Nobody can do malicious attacks with the apis now.


React is JS 
Functional Comp are functions
JSX is React.CreateElement
React.CreateElement is object
