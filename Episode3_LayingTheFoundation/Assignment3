Q1. What is JSX?
-> JSX is XML like syntax or


Q2. Superpowers of JSX
- JSX allows us to write HTML elements in JavaScript and place them in the DOM without any createElement() and/or appendChild() methods.
- We can use JSX to conditionally output some content or data to your DOM safeguards it against an XSS attack as JSX Prevents Injection Attacks.
- JSX also allows React to show more useful error and warning messages.
- JSX helps us in keeping our code simpler and elegant when writing large pieces of code.
- Faster than normal JavaScript as it performs optimizations while translating to regular JavaScript.


Q3. Role of type attribute in script tag? What options can I use there?
-> The type attribute specifies the type of the script. The type attribute identifies the content between the <script> and </script> tags
   The type attribute normally gives language of script or format of data
    => It is used to add the type of scripts like React (module)
    => <script type = "module" src="app.js"></script>
    => <script type = "text/javascript" src="app.js"></script>


Q4. {TitleComponent} vs {<TitleComponent/>} vs {<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>} in JSX
-> 3 ways of calling component
   {TitleComponent} - This is used to add an javascript variable inside an JSX 
            const TitleComponent = 45000
            const Total = () => (
                {TitleComponent}
            )
    
   {<TitleComponent />} - This is used to add as an React Components inside the JSX, that is component inside an component which is known as composable components
            const TitleComponent = () => {
                return <h1>React Components</h1>
            }
            const Display = () => {
                return(
                    <div>
                       <TitleComponent />
                    </div>
                )
            }
    
   {<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>}  - This is used to add as an React Components in JSX, if we have any children elements to render in it

Q5. Babel and Parcel role in JSX 
->  Generally a JSX will be converted to a React.createElement and the parcel consisting of babel[javascript compiler] is the one which does that conversion. after the converion of a javascript object 
          it will be rendered as a HTMl element

Q6. Components
 ->  In React everything is a component. A component is nothing but a javascript function which returns a JSX.
     React consists of Two kinds of components. 
     1. class based components.
     2. Functional components. 
   Functional Components 
    Functional components are the normal javascript functions which returns a JSX code or a react element.
    ex: const FunctionalComponent = () => {
        return (
            <h1> Hello world </h1>
        )
    }
